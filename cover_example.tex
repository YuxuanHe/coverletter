I am particularly interested to begin my career at EA.  It is by far the world's prime mover in developer,marketer, publisher and distributor of video games -- and I want to be part of it.  I believe I have meaningful credentials 
put together from my educational background, work experience, special projects and programs I worked on, along with critical skills and talents I developed over the years, both on campus and in actual work sites.

I will be graduating in December with an M.S. in Computer Science degree from Northwestern University.My bachelor's degree is also in Computer Science.  Prior to my graduate education, I was employed for 3 years with ChinaUnicom as a Networking Engineer, ensuring over 5 million customers for uninterrupted internet service at all times.  I also did internship with Cable Radio & Television Network, Ltd. in Chengdu.  Along the way, I developed skills in HTTP 
client and server and TCP protocol, programming languages and platforms and even developed a personal app for 
restaurant selections.Attached is my resume. 

I hope I'd get the chance to explore employment with EA further and help me unleash my potential.  In return, I assure you of my loyalty and drive, and high level of productivity that starts from Day One. Thank you.
